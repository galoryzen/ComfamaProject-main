From the graph above, we saw that it was not enough with the variables we had. We came up with the idea of creating a new variable that told us if the microenterprise had a bigger or smaller contribution than its average, we called it **aporteMenor**. According to Comfama this average was calculated against microenterprises that were similar. We also did this with the money the microenterprise paid to Comfama. From the new correlation graph we see that these variables have a **high correlation in comparison to the variables we had before.**
